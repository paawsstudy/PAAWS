## Codebooks
In the PAAWS study, there are three separate protocols. They are the free living protocol (FL), the simulated free living and exercise laboratory protocol (SimFL+Lab), and the sleep protocol.
Each of these protocols is detailed below, as well as their respective codebook. 

### Free Living Protocol Codebook
Details of the [data collection protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTYIukWVnybhW7f_6G1sm6RgSfFXasPuuFQwOH_Anuy5VW9kvjR9tV4LBhvOHNI4xeFS9KfkW0IvHm_/pub) and [codebook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSR1Qzj11XjaFJQuqHGDD1YmD0kBgWOBmKDJLqvvzJpypZ7WCWN9RrKX5AnJ-3t1eII8BnSA-GMTkCo/pub).

Note that in the codebook, we refer to an example code to read the data. Please check [sample_code](sample_code) for a Python notebook used to read accelerometer data.

### Lab and Simulated Free Living Protocol Codebook

### Sleep protocol Codebook
Details of the [data collection protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQzi2QLSaTxd-cmOkqaO5Pqi7Z8f35_LtQCdUzKIkQwxqC-1XPcHX_VCdkPoLZdHUMa_-ZjMSCkyINV/pub) and [codebook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vThL6Ik1onU5j4t4JWYeD9ef9fYb4vl0mBs8sE-LWOAmSdBFt7Hp-arS1vDRXKP5Laubv8a5hny8pTJ/pub).

### Benchmarking code 
We release the model we described in section 4 of the paper here [Benchmarking](benchmarking)
